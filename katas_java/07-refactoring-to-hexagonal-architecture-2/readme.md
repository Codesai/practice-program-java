# Birthday Greetings Kata 2

We'll continue refactoring a now less convoluted service to extract the remaining infrastructure logic.

We'll use an architectural style called [hexagonal architecture or ports and adapters](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture).

To practice we'll do [Matteo Vaccari](http://matteo.vaccari.name/blog/)'s Birthday Greetings Refactoring Kata.

To learn more about this great kata, read Matteo's post about it on its blog: [The birthday greetings kata](http://matteo.vaccari.name/blog/archives/154). That post also constains a great explanation of the hexagonal architecture.
