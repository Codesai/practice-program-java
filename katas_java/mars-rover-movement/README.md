# Mars Rover implementation exercise

### Description
In this exercise we'll implement from scratch part of the [Mars Rover kata](https://anirudhbhargava7.wordpress.com/category/katas/). 

This is a summary of the part of the behavior of the rover that we'll implement:

 - It's located on a grid at some point with coordinates (x,y) and facing a direction encoded with a character.

 - The meaning of each direction character is:

      * ``N`` -> North
      * ``S`` -> South
      * ``E`` -> East 
      * ``W`` -> West

 - The rover receives a sequence of commands (a string of characters) which are codified in the following way:

      * When it receives an ``f``, it moves forward one position in the direction it is facing.
      * When it receives a ``b``, it moves backward one position in the direction it is facing.
      * When it receives a ``l``, it turns left changing its direction (by one step in the direction).
      * When it receives a ``r``, it turns right changing its direction (by one step in the direction).
